  abstract = {The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of events in high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multiparticle final state. It contains a library of hard processes, models for initial- and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and several interfaces to external programs. Pythia 8.2 is the second main release after the complete rewrite from Fortran to C++, and now has reached such a maturity that it offers a complete replacement for most applications, notably for LHC physics studies. The many new features should allow an improved description of data. New version program summary Program title: Pythia 8.2 Catalogue identifier: ACTU_v4_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ACTU_v4_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N.

Computer: Commodity PCs, Macs. Operating system: Linux, OS X; should also work on other systems. RAM: ∼10 megabytes Classification: 11.2. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models. Summary of revisions: Hundreds of new features and bug fixes, allowing improved modelling. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied.},

  abstract = {The Fortran LHAPDF library has been a long-term workhorse in particle physics, providing standardised access to parton density functions for experimental and phenomenological purposes alike, following on from the venerable PDFLIB package. During Run 1 of the LHC, however, several fundamental limitations in LHAPDF’s design have became deeply problematic, restricting the usability of the library for important physics-study procedures and providing dangerous avenues by which to silently obtain incorrect results. In this paper we present the LHAPDF 6 library, a ground-up re-engineering of the PDFLIB/LHAPDF paradigm for PDF access which removes all limits on use of concurrent PDF sets, massively reduces static memory requirements, offers improved CPU performance, and fixes fundamental bugs in multi-set access to PDF metadata. The new design, restricted for now to interpolated PDFs, uses centralised numerical routines and a powerful cascading metadata system to decouple software releases from provision of new PDF data and allow completely general parton content. More than 200 PDF sets have been migrated from LHAPDF 5 to the new universal data format, via a stringent quality control procedure. LHAPDF 6 is supported by many Monte Carlo generators and other physics programs, in some cases via a full set of compatibility routines, and is recommended for the demanding PDF access needs of LHC Run 2 and beyond.},

  abstract = {The accurate identification of heavy-flavour jets, those which originate from bottom or charm quarks, is crucial for precision studies of the Standard Model and searches for new physics. However, assigning flavour to jets presents significant challenges, primarily due to issues with infrared and collinear (IRC) safety. This paper aims to address these challenges by evaluating recently-proposed jet algorithms designed to be IRC-safe and applicable in high-precision measurements. We compare these algorithms across benchmark heavy-flavour production processes and kinematic regimes that are relevant for LHC phenomenology. Exploiting both fixed-order calculations in QCD as well as parton shower simulations, we analyse the infrared sensitivity of these new algorithms at different stages of the event evolution and compare to flavour-labelling strategies currently adopted by LHC collaborations. The results highlight that, while all algorithms lead to more robust flavour-assignments compared to current techniques, they vary in performance depending on the observable and energy regime. The study lays groundwork for robust, flavour-aware jet analyses in current and future collider experiments to maximise the physics potential of experimental data by reducing discrepancies between theoretical and experimental methods.},

Good procedures for identifying jets are central to experimental analyses and comparisons with theory. The kt family of successive recombination jet finders has been widely advocated because of its conceptual simplicity and flexibility and its unique ability to approximately reconstruct the partonic branching sequence in an event. Until now however, it had been believed that for an ensemble of N particles the algorithmic complexity of the kt jet finder scaled as N 3, a severe issue in the high multiplicity environments of LHC and heavy-ion colliders. We here show that the computationally complex part of kt jet-clustering can be reduced to two-dimensional nearest neighbour location for a dynamic set of points. Borrowing techniques developed for this extensively studied problem in computational geometry, kt jet-finding can then be performed in N ln N time. Code based on these ideas is found to run faster than all other jet finders in current use.},

It is data driven, does not depend on Monte Carlo modelling and can be used with any jet algorithm for which a jet area can be sensibly defined. We illustrate its effectiveness for some key processes and find that it can be applied also in the context of the Tevatron, low-luminosity LHC and LHC heavy-ion collisions.},

Simulation-to-data correction factors are derived as a function of jet pT for the three data-taking years separately, using each method separately and in the combination scheme.

The Wasserstein Normalized Autoencoder, an improvement on the Normalized Autoencoder model, a normalized probabilistic model constructed from the reconstruction error of an autoencoder, is introduced for the first time. Trained on jets of particles from simulated standard model processes, the Wasserstein Normalized Autoencoder is shown to well learn the probability distribution of the input data in order to effectively tag new physics jets as anomalies in a fully unsupervised fashion. This algorithm has been developed and applied in the context of a recent search for semivisible jets by the CMS Collaboration. The model is found to outperform the Normalized Autoencoder in terms of performance and robustness while remaining agnostic to the signal. The Wasserstein Normalized Autoencoder is shown to directly tackle the problem of outlier reconstruction, a common failure mode of autoencoders in anomaly detection tasks.},

Despite the overwhelming QCD background, recent advances in jet substructure have put the observation of the gg {$\rightarrow$} H {$\rightarrow$} b{\textasciimacron}b channel at the LHC within the realm of possibility. In order to enhance the sensitivity to this process, we develop a two-stream convolutional neural network, with one stream acting on jet information and one using global event properties. The neural network significantly increases the discovery potential of a Higgs signal, both for high-pT Standard Model production as well for possible beyond the Standard Model contributions. Unlike most studies for boosted hadronically decaying massive particles, the boosted Higgs search is unique because double b-tagging rejects nearly all background processes that do not have two hard prongs. In this context --- which goes beyond state-of-the-art two-prong tagging --- the network is studied to identify the origin of the additional information leading to the increased significance. The procedures described here are also applicable to related final states where they can be used to identify additional sources of discrimination power that are not being exploited by current techniques.},

While deep learning has transformed jet tagging and significantly improved performance, the lack of a large-scale public dataset impedes further enhancement.

A total of 10 types of jets are simulated, including several types unexplored for tagging so far. Based on the large dataset, we propose a new Transformer-based architecture for jet tagging, called Particle Transformer (ParT). By incorporating pairwise particle interactions in the attention mechanism, ParT achieves higher tagging performance than a plain Transformer and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art, ParticleNet, by a large margin. The pre-trained ParT models, once fine-tuned, also substantially enhance the performance on two widely adopted jet tagging benchmarks.

  abstract = {As the LHC prepares to start taking data, this review is intended to provide a QCD theorist's understanding and views on jet finding at hadron colliders, including recent developments. My hope is that it will serve both as a primer for the newcomer to jets and as a quick reference for those with some experience of the subject. It is devoted to the questions of how one defines jets, how jets relate to partons, and to the emerging subject of how best to use jets at the LHC.},

  abstract = {Many measurements and searches for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC rely on the efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom or charm quarks. In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated tt{\textasciimacron} events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68\% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1\% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15\%, compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The b jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 GeV) and about 5\% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 GeV).},
